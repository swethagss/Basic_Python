# Basic Python File Coding Problems (for Practice)

This Python file contains a script that demonstrates fundamental concepts and functionalities of Python programming. It includes basic operations, data structures, and common Python features such as:

- **Variables and Data Types**: Declaring variables and working with data types like strings, integers, floats, and lists.
- **Control Flow**: Using `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements for conditional logic.
- **Loops**: Demonstrating `for` and `while` loops for repetitive tasks.
- **Functions**: Defining and calling functions to modularize the code and improve readability.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing basic error handling using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to manage exceptions.
- **File Handling**: Performing basic file operations like reading and writing files.
- **Data Structures**: Working with common Python data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
- **Libraries**: Importing and using built-in Python libraries such as `math`, `os`, and `datetime`.

## Purpose

The purpose of this file is to provide a simple, clear example of how Python can be used for various tasks, from basic operations to more advanced concepts like functions and error handling. It's intended as a learning resource for beginners in Python programming.

## Features

- Illustrates basic Python syntax.
- Covers key concepts that are fundamental for any Python programmer.
